# Notification Offering 

Unlike other Integration Offerings, this offering facilitates invites through a Webhook sent to a URL of the partner's choosing. These "Notifications" will include all relevant details of the invite, including a link for the Partner to pass on to the stated member.

## Integration Requirements 


In order to recieve an invite, a Partner must first register one more more members using the [Member Management API](/membermanagement/). Once registered, Partners may recieve invites for an active member at any time. Partners may define how often an individual member can recieve invites. To modify this setting on an existing integration, please speak with your Toluna Representative.
