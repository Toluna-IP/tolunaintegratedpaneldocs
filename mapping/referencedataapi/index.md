# Reference Data API

The following API calls will allow Partner to request information that can be used in the Partner's data mapping. Use the links listed below to access information on each request. 

For long-term mapping, Toluna suggests that Partners only rely on the Production Repsonses for these calls and they will provide a larger and more accurate inventory.

> Please note: These API calls are still in development. Breaking changes may occur.
