### MemberDetails Object

Members can be registered via the SDK's [Registration Method](/sdk/methods.html#registration) or through use of the [Member Management API](/membermanagement/). The Registration Method can be used directly by the Partner before providing the Member with a Survey/Offer wall. To do so, include the following properties for the MemberDetails object. Without MemberDetails, the Registration Method will prompt a Member to answer demographic questions before routing to the Survey/Offer wall.
