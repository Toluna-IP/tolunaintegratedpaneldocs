# Software Development Kit

Toluna offers an SDK to allow Partners to integrate and begin sending traffic to Toluna-hosted studies quickly and with limited resources.

With its full implementation, the SDK codestack will allow a Partner's members to register themselves within Toluna's system without the Partner needing to gather demographic information from the member and subsequently mapping that data to Toluna.

In the following pages, you will find general information about the SDK, its flow, and the supported platforms.

To download the SDK files, click the button below and sign in. Please contact your Toluna Representative if you do not yet have an account.
