Toluna offers an SDK to allow Partners to integrate and begin sending traffic to Toluna-hosted studies quickly and with limited resources.

With its full implementation, the SDK codestack will allow a Partner's members to register themselves within Toluna's system without the Partner needing to gathering demographic information from the member and subsequently mapping that data to Toluna.

In the following pages, you will find general information about the SDK, its flow, and the supported platforms.
