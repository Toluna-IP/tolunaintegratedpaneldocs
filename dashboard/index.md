## Introduction

Toluna provides a RESTful way to get surveys to display to your panel on your own website. This can be accomplished once the respondent data is loaded into Tolunaâ€™s system. Please note that Toluna caches the results of this call for 1 minute; repeated calls within this timeframe will NOT consult the Toluna router and will instead return the latest results from cache.

## Demographic Requirements

In order to place a Member into a Survey, Toluna must know - at a minimum - the panelist Date of Birth and Gender. When the Dashboard is called for a Member lacking this information, Toluna returns a special result: a single link to a Member Profile page. The panelist can use this link to submit the missing data. Once complete, future calls to the Dashboard will result in the normal result of Survey links.

### Example Response Demographic Data Missing
