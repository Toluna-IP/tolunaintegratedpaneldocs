## Introduction

Toluna provides a RESTful way to get surveys to display to your panel on your own website. This can be accomplished once the respondent data is loaded into Tolunaâ€™s system. Please note that Toluna caches the results of this call for 1 minute; repeated calls within this timeframe will NOT consult the Toluna router and will instead return the latest results from cache.
