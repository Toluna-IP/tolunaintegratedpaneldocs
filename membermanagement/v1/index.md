# Static v1

Within the Toluna IP Database, the Partner has a couple options on how they manage member data. The partner can choose to use either static or dynamic data. In the pages listed below are instructions on using static data. Information on managing members with dynamic data can be found [here.](/membermanagement/v2/ "Member Management v2")


Version 1 of the Member API is focused on speed, simplicity, improved support for demographic characteristics. It’s “closer to the metal” of the underlying Toluna Panel Management System and is optimized to remove internal dependencies. To the Partner, it’s faster and has more capability. It is independent of Static v1 and is managed separately. For the time being, both versions will continue to exist and be supported.
