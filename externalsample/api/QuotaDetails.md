# Quota Details Endpoint
{: no_toc}

At times, it is beneficial for a Partner to obtain the status of a single Quota regardless of whether or not it would be included in the [GetQuotas](/externalsample/api/getquotas) request. This is the purpose of QuotaDetails, an exclusive feature for Partners using ES Integration.

The method, explained below, reveals if the requested Quota is available for ES, if the Partner qualifies for the Quota, and the Quota details (provided the Partner qualifies).
