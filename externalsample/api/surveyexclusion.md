SurveyWaveExclusion will be shown when using the [GetQuotas](/externalsample/api/getquotas.html) request. The following are the response details specific to SurveyWaveExclusions. If there are no exclusions specified, the SurveyWaveExclusions object will be empty.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SurveyID | ```int``` | The integer idendifier of the excluded Survey |
| WaveID | ```int```` | The integer identifier of the excluded Wave associated with the excluded Survey. An exclusion with a WaveID=0 should be interpreted as the exclusion applying to any Wave of the associated Survey. WaveID should not be populated if SurveyID is empty |
| ParticipationStatusID | ```array<int>``` | Should always contain at least one integer. Integers represent the Member's participation statuses of the associated Survey/Wave that should be excluded. Values are as follows: 1 = started (Member accessed the SurveyURL), 3 = Terminated, 9 = Qualified, 10 = QuotaFull |

Exclusions for a Survey can change over type, affecting the number of Members that are excluded from the new SurveyID+WaveID.
