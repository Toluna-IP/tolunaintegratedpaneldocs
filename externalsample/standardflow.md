# External Sample - Standard Flow

##### Real-Time Flow Diagram

![ES Standard Flow](https://tolunaonline-my.sharepoint.com/personal/joshua_austin_toluna_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/IP%20Flow%20Diagrams%20(2).png)


##### Get Quotas

Using your culture-specific "PanelGUID" provided by Toluna, call this route to obtain a current inventory of the application open Toluna Quotas.


##### Sample, Invite

Once Quota data is obtained, use your own sampling capability to match a Toluna Quota with one of your Members. Toluna will provide a document that links its profile attributes to a series of "AnswerIDs" found on each Quota. Partners can use this to map these details to their own standards. When a match is found, call Toluna and get an invite for the Member/Quota combination. Among other things, Toluna will provide a pre-formatted and "ready-to-go" invitation link.


##### Execute Invitation

Place the Invitation link in your Member's possession according to your internal workflow. Once executed, it behaves like any other (non-ES) IP invite.


##### Take Survey

Once the invitation is exercised, the Partner Member takes a Survey in the Toluna ecosystem. This process is identical to any other in the IP Program; no special provisions or action are required for ES-based experience


##### Survey Conclusion

Upon conclusion of the Survey, the Partner Member is redirected ack to a Partner-specific landing page. The options for redirection are identical to non-ES integration and can be found in Toluna's main integration guide.
