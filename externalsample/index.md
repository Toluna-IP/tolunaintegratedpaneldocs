# External Sample Offering

### What is External Sample?

Toluna’s “External Sample” (ES) capability is an integration option offered as part of the Integrated Panel program. Its adoption permits the Partner to receive near real-time details about Toluna’s open quotas. Once obtained, Partners can use their own sampling capabilities to target the most appropriate respondents. This differs from the traditional IP model where Toluna maintains complete control over the sampling, routing, and invitation processes.

To Toluna's Platform, the existing IP Framework views ES as simply another option for getting survey invitations into the hands of its Partners. As such, Partners choosing to adopt this capability are required to add only a few additional integration points beyond the traditional model.

## Demographic Requirements

** In order to place a Member into a Survey, Toluna must know - at a minimum - the panelist Date of Birth and Gender. **

### Getting Started
