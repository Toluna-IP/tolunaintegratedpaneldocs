## Step 1 - Contact Toluna

Contact Toluna to discuss details and the integration offering that best fits your needs. 

## Step 2 - Member Management

Once provided with culture-specific panel guids to our Sandbox environment, the best place to start integrating is on [Member Management](/membermanagement). This component is central to integrating with our platform and is a required connection pointin in all integration offerings. 

## Step 3 - Member Routing

Review the [Member Routing](/memberroutiung) section as it outlines the flow of the member experience once an inviture url is procured. 

## Step 4 - Specific Integration Offering

Begin integrating the needed connection points for the desired integrating offering. We currently offer the following options:

- [Notification](/notification)
- [Dashboard](/dashboard)
- [External Sample](/externalsample)

Each of these offerings have their own requirements and flows - please be sure to understand the underlying integration flow. 

## Step 5 - Mapping
Mapping your platform's data to our platform's is a critical part of the integration process. Please check out the [Mapping](/mapping) section which demonstrates how to go about translationg data points between our two platforms. 

## Step 6 - Notifications
Along with each integration offering there comes notifications (webhooks) that can be consumed by your platform to help performance and security. Check our the [notifications](/notifications) section to learn about the various notification types and their needed integration points. 

## Step 7 - Test
Once the required integration pints have been setup, please test the integration through mimicing member behaviour and tracing the flow from start to finish. Please reach out with any questions or for help assistance. 

## Step 8 - Go Live
Once tested and ready to go live, Toluna will move your integration to Production and issue updated culture-specific panel-guids and api key. You are then ready to route member throug the integration.
