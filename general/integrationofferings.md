## [Notification Offering](/notification)
This is the oldest integration offering in which Toluna performs the sampling and sends [invite notifications](/notifications/invite.html) to the partner and they are able to pass along the opportunity to the member.


## [Dashboard Offering](/dashboard)
This offering allows partners to request a small inventory of current survey opportunities for a member. The partner then routes the member accordingly to the opportunity through the provided invite url. 


## [External Sample Offering](/externalsample)
This is the newest offereing and places the sampling processs (member - survey selection) to the partner. The partner requests a real-time inventory of available quotas, selects which members qualify for which quotas, and then requests invite urls for these member-quota pairs. Once an invite url is provided back by the Toluna platform the partner can route the member accordingly.
