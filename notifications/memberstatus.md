# Member Status Notifications

When a Partner Member has completed interaction with a Toluna Survey, Toluna will deliver a notification signifying this event and its details. For the most part, these are identical to the "real-time" notifications described in the main Integration Guide. Subscription to these notification are required for ES Partners.

The following is information on the two types of Member Status Notification
 - Terminated: *To do*
 - Completed: *To do*


### Member Status Notifications

These are issued upon conclusion of a Partner Member’s experience with a Toluna Survey. Partners must consume them in order to understand the outcome of their Member’s invitation to the Survey. In general, they take two forms: Termination and Completion. Both are existing features of the Toluna IP System, and documentation regarding their details can be found in the standard integration guide. ES partners also get ‘QuotaID’ in their notifications.
