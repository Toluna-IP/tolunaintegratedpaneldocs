# Pre-Start Notifications 
{: .no_toc}

In certain instances, Members will click on a Survey invite but the experience will be Terminated before the Member is routed through the Toluna Platform. These instances can occur for mutiple reaons (e.g. the Member attempted to initiate the experience after the Survey or Invite Link has expired). 

Since the Member does not start the Survey experience before they are Terminated, these notifications are call "Pre-Start" Notifications, and are exucuted in similar fashion as the Terminates notifications, details on which can be found [here](/notifications/memberstatus.html#terminates).
