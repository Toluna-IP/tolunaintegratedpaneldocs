## trackers

A "Tracker" is a series of related Surveys. Toluna calls each iteration of these Surveys a "Wave." Each iteration will share a common SurveyID and its own WaveID. Toluna recommends that the Partner considers the combination of SurveyID+WaveID as the "unique identifier" for a Member's interation with a Survey. For the complete details of trackers and their benefits, pleae refer to the main Integration Guide.
