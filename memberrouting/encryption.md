# Toluna IP Platform Standard Encryption Offering
{: .no_toc}

We provide encryption in two places on the IP Platform: [member status notifications](/notifications/memberstatus) and on [End Page Redirection](/memberrouting/endpages) back to the Partner. This outlines the offerings and the information needed to utilize the feature.  

> Please note: any deviation from the standard offering would require custom development and needs to be discussed with your Toluna Business Representative.
